# Dr.BeGonE for Resident Evil Village

**Status: in testing. No download yet.** A download comes only after every long weapon passes the test in
the main README.

## What is here

`reframework/autorun/re8_vrz_begone_grip.lua`: the stacked two-handed grip, for REFramework's built-in RE8 VR
mode by praydog. Hold the left grip button with the left controller 3 to 35 cm above the right one. The weapon
then aims with the right hand alone, and the drawn left hand stays on the forestock.

It is VR only. On a flat screen it loads and does nothing.

Since 2026-10-01/02 it also takes over praydog's two-handed grip, worn and proven on 2026-10-02:

- **The grip spot is frozen when the grip is taken.** Praydog steers the weapon against the grip spot the game's
  animation gives him each frame, and the firing pose moves that spot by about five degrees, so the first shot after
  taking the grip jerked the rifle. The animation may move its own hand now; the weapon does not follow.
- **The grip is the script's own decision.** It takes when praydog docks (hand within 10 cm of the spot) and keeps
  holding while your real hand stays on the rifle, through the bolt action and the reload animation. Praydog's own
  dock drops the moment the animation swings his hand spot away, which snapped the rifle to one-handed aim at every
  shot; that no longer happens.
- **Auto-dock stays on.** The hand near the rifle grabs it, no button needed (Tefa's choice). `grip button 1` makes
  the left grip button the only way to grip, live.
- **The shot itself is covered.** Praydog re-runs his hand update inside the gun's shoot function; this file hooks
  the same function after him and puts its steering back before the bullet.
- **The frozen spot is only taken from a hand that can be trusted** (2026-10-02, not yet worn). After a relaunch
  the first dock froze the spot while the draw animation was still moving the hand, and the rifle pointed far right
  for the rest of the session. Now the spot is frozen only once the animation's hand has held still for 0.3 s, or
  sits within 10 cm of the captured rifle grip; until then praydog's own steering stays. A weapon change, or five
  seconds without a grip, forgets it. `grip forget` drops it live.

What remains is the game's own move: it turns the rifle toward its aim point in the frames before the bullet, one-handed
too; the scope mod's picture looks back a few frames to cover it.

It runs right after each of praydog's hand updates, using only REFramework's public Lua API, and checks itself: the
file recomputes the controller poses the way praydog's C++ does and compares its right hand with his on every
pass (`pose check: … the recompute is right` after 300 agreeing passes, `POSE CHECK FAILED` otherwise; 0.0 mm on
the first wear). Harness words: `grip button 0|1`, `grip freeze 0|1`, `grip check`, `grip forget`, `grip` (the state line, with
how far the hand sits from the frozen spot and when it is forgotten).

## Where it came from

On 2026-10-01 it was split out of the RE Village VR Scope mod (`re8_vrz_scope_left_grip.lua`, shipped in its
v1.0.0 and v1.0.1). The grip code itself was not changed. The scope mod keeps its weapon-click silencing and
left-menu-button fix in its own file.

## Not done yet

- **It still needs the scope mod.** It only acts while the scope's rifle camera exists, so today it works with
  the sniper rifle only. Standing alone for every long weapon needs a way to tell which weapon is held, read
  from the game while it runs.
- **It still uses the scope's settings file** for the captured hand spot (`reframework/data/re_scope_left_grip.txt`),
  so a spot captured before the split keeps working.
- **Worn 2026-10-02 (home PC, Tefa):** the grip holds through shots, the button-only mode works when switched on,
  the pose check agrees to 0.0 mm. **But after a relaunch the rifle pointed far right**: the first dock froze the grip
  spot while another weapon / the draw animation was in the hand, and every grip after that kept it. **Not ready.**
  Still to do: forget the frozen spot when the weapon changes and after a while without a grip, and never freeze it
  from a first dock mid-animation. Taken out of the game folder; the scope mod's v1.0.2 stays the shipped build.
- **Praydog has not been sent the grip rules upstream yet.**

## Test

`re-village-scope-vr` staging: `scripts/tests/grip_split_test.lua` loads this file and the scope's half
separately and checks that each one starts on its own and answers its words; `scripts/tests/begone_grip_fixes_test.lua`
checks the two fixes are on by default, answer their words, and that the steering maths turns the right way.
