"""knowledge.py -- the growing knowledge base: what a jittery VR camera looks like in the numbers, what a smooth one
looks like, and which measures separate the two. One entry per PATTERN, never per session, so it holds no copies.

    python knowledge.py ingest <run folder>            add one filed session (the rider does this by itself)
    python knowledge.py label <run> jittery|smooth [note]   what it FELT like in the headset: the truth the base learns from
    python knowledge.py rebuild                        re-read every session in data/ (after a checker change)
    python knowledge.py report                         rewrite knowledge/FINDINGS.md from the base

HOW IT GROWS WITHOUT COPIES: a session's turning seconds are boiled down to a fingerprint, the median of each
measure rounded into a bucket (camera writes per picture to 0.05, shares to 0.05, pose age to 2 ms, ...). Two
sessions with the same fingerprint are the same pattern: the entry gets a tally, the session's run name and its
game, nothing else. A new fingerprint is a new entry. The label (jittery / smooth, from the person wearing the
headset) sticks to the pattern, and a pattern that has been called both is flagged as a contradiction to look at.

HOW IT FINDS THE WHY: for each measure, the values across every jittery pattern and across every smooth pattern.
A measure whose two ranges do not overlap separates the groups; the report says so, per game and across games.
