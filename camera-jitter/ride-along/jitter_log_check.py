"""jitter_log_check.py -- read a .jl file a VR mod wrote (jitterlog.h / jitterlog.lua) and say WHY the view jitters.

    python jitter_log_check.py <file.jl> [--out <folder>]      check one log; writes summary.json, report.md, chart.png
    python jitter_log_check.py selftest                        made-up logs with known faults, every verdict checked

Three streams per frame: P = the mod read the headset pose, C = the mod wrote the camera, F = a picture went out.
Per second of log, while the head is turning, it measures:
  camera held      share of pictures that went out with a camera identical to the picture before   -> JITTER
  camera rate      camera writes per picture                                                        -> the rate fault
  pose repeated    share of pose reads identical to the read before, while the head moved           -> stale pose
  pose age         how old the pose was when the camera was written (ms)                            -> latency
  camera lag       the camera matching the pose BEFORE last better than the last one                -> one-frame lag
Vocabulary is Tefa's (claude-memory PREFERENCES.md, "what jittery means"): JITTER = stepped under a smooth slow turn.
